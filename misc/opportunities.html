<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><p> One of the opportunities automation presents is the availability of previously impossible tasks under normal circumstances. For example, the ocean has always 
	been covered with a veil of mystery. The reason for this is the intense pressure of the deep ocean that only increases the further down you go. However, recent 
	innovations of ARVs (Autonomous and Remotely-operated Vehicles) have made it possible to safely descend to depths that would normally result in a highly dangerous 
	piloted expedition . These ARVs carry out autonomous research missions in order to map the seafloor and collect samples in extreme marine environments. China in 
	particular has been quite invested in the manufacturing of ARVs and after 20 years it has become a major research focus for underwater vehicle development. One example 
	is the Chinese ARV Haidou which carried out a mission in the Challenger Deep of the Mariana Trench in 2016. It was capable of reaching a depth of 10,888 meters in 
	autonomous mode and for the first time ever documented real time footage of the sea floor below 10,000 meters (Tangi et. al, 2020).</p>

<p>Another example of the opportunities automation presents can be found in the animal husbandry industry. The traditional method of feeding livestock 
	comes with a plethora of negative effects such as poor sanitary conditions, serious pollution issues and requires a great deal of manpower to perform. 
	Automation of feeding livestock is believed to be the solution to solving these key issues in order to promote healthy and sustainable farming. In fact, 
	there are quite a few companies in the world that have already integrated some form of automation into animal husbandry, such as the Velos system in the Netherlands 
	where electronic ear markers are attached to sows in order to identify and monitor the sow’s condition. Prototypes of automatic feeding systems, such as the RA-DOS 
	automatic feeding system in Denmark, have been designed to efficiently feed livestock by accurately measuring daily feeding amounts and matches feeding times to when 
	livestock approach the feeding trough. Test results showed that while the precision of the pressure sensor in the RA-DOS needs to be improved in order to more 
	accurately measure forage residue in the feeding bucket, the design showed a greatly reduced use of labor force and an increased efficiency in saving livestock feed 
	(Jing et. al, 2021).</p>

<p>One more example of the opportunities of automation can be seen in office environments. While factories have seen a high degree of automation since the 1980s, 
	office automation has remained rather sedentary seeing only a 3% increase in automation. This is likely due to the technology for automation in office use 
	not being scientifically feasible at the time. Recently however, a new solution has been developed called the RPA (Robotic Process Automation) which aims to 
	mimic human interaction with mundane office resources such as reading emails, writing reports and entering data. The main benefit of RPA is the fact that it can 
	work 24 hours a day and at a speed that’s 15 times faster than a human worker. A study in 2017 found that company productivity improved an estimated 86% after 
	integrating the RPA system, as well as boosting quality and compliance above 90%. Benefits of the RPA system weren’t only limited to workers however. The 
	RPA system aimed to improve customer satisfaction by increasing processing times, as well as avoiding human error when processing such as delivering mismatched 
	items to the customer (Axmann & Harmoko, 2020).</p>
