<p>Throughout all my research for the topic I ultimately found that there are too many issues to implement automation as it is currently. The largest 
		concern I have is the loss of job for many workers due to their role becoming automated. Although the benefits of automation can significantly 
		improve the efficiency of businesses and can make the life of other workers a lot easier, I feel that automation is not ready to be fully implemented 
		and there needs to be more research into addressing the concerns surrounding the loss of work. In terms of automated software there is also the 
		concerns of overworking staff in cases like the Amazon Time off Task system. Or how automated HR systems are rife with gender discrimination. 
		I do not believe that businesses are to be trusted with the best interest of their workers, and that ultimately, third party intervention would be
		needed to ensure that all the concerns are properly addressed. A large reason for why automation is so anti-worker is that it is designed to cut 
		costs and be more cost-efficient. However, through my research I found that it can be possible to automate a process whilst also upholding the 
		dignity of the worker, more research into these aspects could make that solution more cost efficient in the long run.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is the Nokia Bridge program, after many layoffs, Nokia created a program for its employees that allowed them to move to a
	different role in the company or even study to move to a whole new career path entirely. If a company did implement automation to the point that 
	layoffs are required, I feel it would be just to allow them the chance for further career development and to support that change as much as possible. 
	In today’s society, especially amidst this global pandemic, job security is at an all-time low and I feel that the low-skill workers are not really 
	respected as they should be. This program would provide employees with security in uncertain times and allow them to find a new job rather than just 
	kicking them to the kerb.</p>

<p>Another issue I feel needs to be rightly addressed are situations much like Amazon’s Time off Task system. While automation does bring much higher productivity, 
	the abilities of the worker do also need to be considered. In the case of Amazon, workload is so high that workers are over-worked, not even taking 
	sufficient toilet breaks in some facilities for fear of disciplinary action. Again, I think there needs to be third party intervention to ensure that 
	employers cannot be treated this way. Huge corporations like Amazon would only care if their bottom line is affected, the rights of the workers mean 
	little to a company that large. </p>

<p>In conclusion, I think that Automation is a very good thing, and it could bring about some much-needed change in businesses and could cause the economy to 
	flourish. However, I feel that there still needs to be substantial research into how this would impact the workers and there needs to be an independent 
	party (be it a union or some new entity) that would ensure that the rights of the worker are still respected. There also needs to be a chance for 
	workers to be integrated into the newly automated process to try and prevent as much job loss as possible.
