	<p>When looking at the choice of adding automation into an organisation or business, I think augmented automation is the way of the future. There are various risks and ethical problems that can arise, but I think the positives in this technology outweigh the negatives.</p>

<p>I think augmented automation is an exciting and clever technology that has an important place both today and in the future. Augmented automation technology appears to be the way to improve and support human actions and decision making. It is a very exciting area for businesses to develop to reduce human error and injury, reduce the physical toll on workers, increase cost efficiency and allow employees more time to be creative problem solvers using their human judgement and intuition. To me it seems like the best solution as it keeps humans in control of the automation and allows them to complete high level tasks safely, in a quicker time and more effectively.</p>

<p>Introducing automation into an organisation opens the doors to some ethical concerns and considerations around the way this impacts on society. The first area that is a real risk to society and concerns me a lot is the possibily of bias and discrimination in this technology that could be either unintentional or deliberate. The ACM Council (2018) Code of Ethics and Professional conduct 1.4 that is used by IT professions outside of New Zealand, states that “a computing professional should be fair and take action not to discriminate.” It is very concerning that studies have shown that algorithms can replicate biases that are already in society. Sandel (n.d., as cited in Pazzanese, 2020) states that Augmented Automation replicates human biases and it makes these biases have a scientific credibility. The technology makes it appear that the computer has made the decision objectively. The ACM Code of Ethics 1.2 states “ computing professional has an additional obligation to report any signs of system risks that might result in harm.” (ACM Council 2018). This requires honesty if biases and discrmination are found. These sort of conversations can be difficult especially if you discover your algorithms have created the problem. If they have been created by others within a workplace, you have a responsibility to report it to leaders.</p>

<p>Although in New Zealand the ITP New Zealand Code of Ethics gives guidelines and professional advice it concerns me that there are not any regulatory bodies that screen for potential breaches in ethics affecting society. At the moment things are self policed. Being a member of the ITP New Zealand is optional but it does give important guidelines around ethical practices. This has implications for automation technology as it is up to organisations to put systems in place to check for biases and discrimination or other things that affect safety. Having a government department or other regulatory body to screen for potential social harms in the algorithms would be ideal, but I also can see that this would not be practical as it would be very time consuming, costly and would slow down innovation. I think joining ITP NZ should be compulsory for all technology professionals as then everyone is required to follow the code of ethics.</p>

<p>Another concern for society with automation is around privacy and surveillance. The rise in cyber crime, identity theft, data leaks, and other unethical behaviour is very concerning for both IT professionals and society. I think this is a huge concern for everyone but I don’t think the development of augmented automation should stop because of this cybercrime. The responsibility of an IT professional creating this technology would be to implement safety measures to protect the programming to the best industry standards against these sorts of crime. Being skilled enough to stop the cybercrime could be challenging and I think that is why keeping the ITP Code of Ethics requires members to maintain professional development each year and also to be careful about work undertaken that is within your qualifications and competence.</p>

<p>The human impact of using automation technology can be positive as it takes the monotony away from repetitive work and allows more time for problem solving and collaborating. The concern around boredom in a workplace and the stresses that come from trying to stay focussed particularly around the safety of the operation is an area that needs to be monitored by employers and management. Staff wellbeing can be affected both physically and mentally so I think it is important to adapt processes to avoid boredom and fatigue when roles become supervisory. This may be with the way alerts are given which ask for decisions to be made that allows for human judgement or intuition.</p>

<p>The obvious impact of automation is the potential for job losses, particularly for those with less skills. This has a far reaching social implication with unemployment, reliance on welfare, cost and stress of retraining staff. Leaders in business need to follow correct procedures around employment laws to ensure redundant staff are given support and opportunities to retrain if this is applicable. Even though there is the potential for job losses, augmented automation means that many jobs are retained because humans are being assisted rather than being taken over by complete automation.</p>

<p>In summary, I think that augmented automation is the way of the future. Although there are various risks, the positive outcomes and choices from this technology outweigh the negative. The reduction of the physical toll on humans, reducing the risk of injury or human errors is really important in organisations moving forward. Improving cost efficiency in the long run and allowing employees to be assigned to different roles in the business will help companies to be profitable and better innovators in the future. I think it is essential that IT professionals use a code of ethics to guide and inspire their work as their algorithms and decisions have the ability to change the world. Their work should always benefit society while protecting humans rights and minimising negative effects on privacy, safety, health and personal security. </p>
