<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul>

<p>After compiling all our research together, our team came together and came up with all the choices available when choosing to adopt automation. 
	Each choice comes with their own risks and benefits, usually a selection of the risks and benefits that automation brings. When considering the risks and 
	benefits that automation brings, we concluded on 4 main choices. These are:</p>
	
	<p><li>Choose not to adopt automation (leave the process manual).</li></p>
	<p><li>Automate parts of the process.</li></p>
	<p><li>Fully automate the process.</li></p>
	<p><li>Look for a middle ground between human and machine operation (augmentative automation).</li></p>
	
<p>In this section we will discuss each of these choices individually, weighing up both the benefits they provide and the risks they pose. With the aim of 
	coming to a single choice which we deem to be the safest choice when adopting automation in the workplace.</p>

<p>When choosing not to adopt automation, the main risk factor is human error. According to Stats NZ, the number of ACC claims for 
	workplace injuries in 2019 was 238,100 with manual labourers and trade workers having the highest proportion of those claims at 
	41,500 [1]. This is an astronomical amount of potentially serious injuries in a single year. Ultimately this will be detrimental for
	all parties involved. The worker is unable to work for some time due to injury, and both the government and potentially the employer will 
	cover the costs of the injury. Without automation present the risk of injury in the workplace, especially industrial areas, will be a lot higher. 
	This was shown in a study titled “Musculoskeletal Injuries and Automations in Aerial Port Operations” [2], in which the researchers looked at the 
	injury reports of both aerial port technicians and traffic management technicians in air force bases. The end conclusion of the study being that the 
	port which used automation had a significantly lower rate of injury than the ports that did not use automation. As far as the benefits of not using 
	automation, it removes a lot of the ethical issues that comes with automation. The primary impact is that workers would not lose their jobs to automation.</p>

<p>When automating only certain portions of a process the results can vary drastically depending on what exactly is automated. It could be a 
	physical part of the task like a conveyor belt or even an automated HR software that handles hiring and other HR tasks. This could be a
	good solution to a lot of the risks that automation presents, as it still allows for human involvement in the process and (depending on
	what is automated) would mean that less jobs are lost than full automation. The benefits, again really depending on what is automated, 
	could be that the risk of injury for workers is reduced if the intensive physical labour is automated, leaving the more precise actions for 
	the workers to complete. According to Jason Del Rey from vox [3], a representative from Amazon said that warehouse workers used to end up 
	walking 10 to 20 miles a day on hard concrete floors. However, now there are picking robots who will take that role and the worker will instead
	stay at the production line and sort what the robot brings to them. When combined with the efforts of humans, automation can be an incredibly 
	useful tool in a business place. That is why we believe that partial implementation of automation could be beneficial for all parties involved if
	implemented correctly.</p>

<p>When looking at the full impact of entirely automating a process, we can simply look at the opportunities and risks:</p>
	<p>To see our assessment of the opportunities, see here: [link to opportunities page]</p>
	<p>To see our assessment of the risks, see here: [link to risks page]</p>
	
<p>Overall, although automation is an incredibly useful tool, we find that total automation is more of a negative than a positive, as the risks outweigh the 
	opportunities. We feel that this is only an appropriate choice in situations that would normally be incredibly perilous for humans. For example, 
	space probes/rovers, AUV, or robotics that work in incredibly high temperatures in factories. As these examples enable the safety of the workers by 
	using expendable technology instead.  In every other aspect however, we deem that full automation is not only unnecessary, but detrimental to a lot of the workers.</p>

<p>The fourth and final choice we found in our research was to find a middle ground between both human and machine operated processes. This form of augmented 
	automation would be a process which is carried out by a machine that is operated or overseen by one or more human workers. This takes the efficiency 
	boost that comes from machine operated processes and combines it with the nuanced decision-making abilities of humans. Overall, we feel this to also 
	be a strong choice when adopting automation. As it would bring all the benefits of automation while also addressing some of the risks involved, such 
	as a loss of work. Also, having the workers actively work alongside the machinery (rather than just being replaced by it) could work to quell any resistance 
	to the new technology. Another example of this could be in the software space, automated HR software has been shown to have biases, usually discriminatory
	against female workers. To remedy this the decisions made by the software could be overseen and audited by a human to ensure discrimination of any kind is
	not occurring.
