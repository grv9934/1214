<h1>Technology Risks</h1>
	
</ul>
	
<p><b>Costs:</b>
    The cost to invest in the setup of automated technology and its maintenance is at a higher level. There is a reliance on correctly functioning
    algorithms and components so the technology works flawlessly as it interacts with people. This means there needs to be suitably skilled personnel
    to make the right decisions and this comes at a cost to either hire someone already highly skilled or re-train staff to fulfill the need.</p>
    <hr>

  <p><b>Resistance to new technology:</b>
      As companies change to new technologies, there can be resistance from workers. Employers need to help workers understand that the new technology
      is there to enhance and benefit employees. They may need time and education to realise that automation is removing the monotony of repetitive and
      mundane tasks and allows them to be creative and reimagine their jobs.</p>
      <hr>

  <p><b>Job losses:</b>
    Job losses are often the first thing people worry about when introducing new technology. Old jobs are replaced by technology and this is a problem
    that is occurring around the world. With augmented automation, new jobs will be created but people will need to retrain to keep up. Many unskilled
    people will become job displaced. &#8243;if people aren't upskilled, the threat of job displacement will rise.&#8243; McCargow (2018, as cited in Thomas, 2019)
    Countries will need to come up with strategies and systems to help people socially who are out of work. This may be by introducing funded retraining
    schemes or minimum living allowances for families while people are job displaced.
    <p>For a country like New Zealand, we are at risk of businesses outsourcing from a low-cost country such as China. As some augmented technology
    requires a lower skill level, taking production overseas can be an attractive alternative to save money.  This causes unemployment if businesses or
    factories close down locally. There is the risk of employee exploitation overseas as labour laws around work conditions and wages differ between countries.
    <p>Not everyone believes augmented automation will cause job losses. McCargow (2018, as cited in Thomas, 2019) said that augmentation in the future
    workforce would play a large role and he was optimistic that jobs would be created which enhanced skills we already have and free people up to
    collaborate and problem solve.</p>
    <hr>

  <p><b>Inequality between countries:</b>
    (Thomas 2019) noted that countries like the USA and China will benefit from automated technology and in particular augmented technology. Less developed
    countries like Africa, will struggleto fund such technology and find skilled workers to implement it. Technologies are moving quickly and third-world
    countries are at risk of being left behind. When new augmented automation is introduced, intellectual property rights remain in a country of development.
    This is where the economic benefits also remain. The gap between rich and poor countries will increase.</p>
    <hr>

  <p><b>Algorithms can make Augmentative automation discriminatory:</b>
    There have been documented cases where augmentative automation has unintended consequences that are discriminatory or unethical. There is a need for
    data ethicists to monitor augmented automation and check for biases that may occur around sexism, racism etc. Dastin (2018) reported that Amazon's
    recruitment engine had an unintended bias in the algorithm which meant there was a gender prejudice against selecting females as suitable candidates
    for positions. Amazon recruiters looked at the recommendations provided by the recruitment engine when employing staff but they have since disbanded
    the team working on it once this bias was detected.</p>

  <p><b>Danger of boredom:</b>
    Thackray (1981, as cited in Cummings et al., n.d.) explained that when a person's work becomes supervisory and only has an activity for brief periods,
    there is a risk the worker becomes fatigued due to boredom or monotony. In a job that requires a high level of attention but the effort has been reduced
    due to automation, this can lead to stress trying to maintain the required alertness. In a safety-critical setting such as a flight controller, this is
    an extreme risk.
    <br>The risk of boredom, lapses in attention and fatigue are important risks to consider when implementing augmented automation. If the job requires
    high levels of attention that is essential for thing to operate safely, the stress can be considerable. Boredom can also flow through and affect staff
    retention and absenteeism.  Cummings et al,. (n.d.) warned that boredom at work can lead to a health problem such as depression, anxiety, cardiovascular
    disease, and for some people it may lead to recreational drug use. </p>

  <p><b>Cybercrime:</b>
  With workplaces turning towards automation, there risks of cyber-attacks and crime increase. The risk of data breaches and threats to businesses using
  cloud-based servers has the threat to expose sensitive data. We have seen this recently in the security breach at the Waikato DHB computer system.
  Ryznar (2019) states that cybercrime can result in sensitive information being intercepted, internet connections being disrupted and system intrusions
  in wearable devices occurring such as hosting malware, enabling cameras, disrupting operations, collecting data, and corrupting work. </p>
