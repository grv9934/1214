<h1>Automation</h1>
	
</ul>
	
<p>Automation is a process where machines reduce the need for human interaction and complete tasks automatically. The term ‘automation’ 
	spans an incredibly broad spectrum, from basic physical interaction to complex thinking and problem solving.</p>

<p>We chose automation as our topic because it’s an interesting topic that has been around for a very long time. Basic automation has been around since as 
	early as 1771, where the first automated spinning mill was invented. Since then the automation of tasks have helped revolutionise society in a major way.</p>

<p>Automation is significant to society because it’s not just an idea that’s looming around the corner. Automation is everywhere, from automatic parking 
	meters on the side of the road, to complex infrastructures that tie large corporations together. It’s an undeniable fact that automation has already 
	become an integral part of society and will only continue to do so as time goes on. For example, Tesla has already developed cars that are capable of 
	driving by themselves and are now only awaiting new laws to officially allow them on public roads. Digital assistants such as Siri or Google have become 
	an essential part of most people’s lives and are only growing smarter as time passes thanks to the AI’s learning capabilities. Automation has become so 
	important that you would be hard pressed not to find some sort of automation in your day to day life.</p>
