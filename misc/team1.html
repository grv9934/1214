<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations</h2>

<p>Ever since the idea of automation came about there has always been one very important dilemma that came attached to it: What happens to my job after it’s automated? 
		The earliest example of this fear of unemployment can be dated back to the early days of the industrial revolution around 1811. Artisans in the textile 
		industry who were threatened by automatic mills rebelled and formed a large resistance to protest against the mechanisation (Nakamura & Zeira, 2018). This 
		fear has not dissipated and instead is an increasing concern in society’s eager adoption of automation. A study at Oxford University has estimated that within
		20 years, 47% of jobs will be susceptible to automation. These jobs range from truck drivers and warehouse workers, to health care managers and accountants 
		which is hypothesized to create widespread unemployment. Some believe these fears to be unwarranted as the current unemployment rate in the US alone is only 
		5%, however a greater percentage of workers have recognised that becoming technologically informed will become an essential part of future workplace conduct.
		Job prospects have also begun to diminish in recent years due to the increasing introduction of automation in workplaces. Less educated workers are constantly 
		having their positions threatened as automatic technology prices fall while at the same time increases in capability and efficiency (McClure, 2017).</p>
	
	
<p>So it begs the question, how do we solve this problem? Clearly automation is something that isn’t just going to go away because there are a few strings attached. 
	One of the most promising choices, as well as my own personal recommendation, is for workplaces to adopt augmentation instead of full automation. The concept of 
	augmentation is when machines work alongside humans to fulfil a goal rather than solely leaving it to the machine. This would allow workplaces to have the benefit 
	of both worlds: The machine’s efficiency and the human’s complex thinking. The integration of augmentation in workplaces would mean that there would be an increase
	in productivity and efficiency, while still having a need for human workers which would greatly help the ‘technological unemployment’ dilemma (Sebastian & Sebastian,
	2021). In fact, there have been a few examples of when full automation has had a negative impact and instead brought down productivity. The CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, 
	has admitted that their Model 3 production was actually slowing down as a result of having machines automate a few key components of the production line which was 
	normally done manually (Van Hove, 2020). While this option does somewhat fix the societal issue automation brings to a degree, there are still some negative 
	implications that could be problematic. One of these implications is that augmentation could cause a digital divide, where those without the resources and capabilities
	to implement augmentation would judge others who could. Companies that could successfully implement augmentation would see a huge increase in productivity and widen 
	the gap between those who couldn’t afford to implement it (Sebastian & Sebastian, 2021). Of course, this is largely speculation and we wouldn’t 100% know until 
	augmentation was properly established. Nonetheless, I believe that augmentation is the way for future workplace automation as it takes the benefits of automation 
	while still needing the qualities of humans to function, allowing for more jobs to remain open.</p>
